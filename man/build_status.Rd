\usage{
build_status(
  sources,
  db = "site/built/md5sum.txt",
  rebuild = FALSE,
  write = FALSE,
  format = c("md", "ipynb")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sources}{a character vector of ALL source files OR a single file to be
rebuilt. These must be \emph{absolute paths}}

\item{db}{the path to the database}

\item{rebuild}{if the files should be rebuilt, set this to TRUE (defaults to
FALSE)}

\item{write}{if TRUE, the database will be updated, Defaults to FALSE,
meaning that the database will remain the same.}

\item{format}{the format of the built files. Either \code{"md"} (the default) for Markdown, or
\code{"ipynb"} for Jupyter notebooks.}
}
\value{
a list of the following elements
\itemize{
\item \emph{build} absolute paths of files to build
\item \emph{new} a new data frame with three columns:
\itemize{
\item file the relative path to the source file
\item checksum the md5 sum of the source file
\item built the relative path to the built file
}
\item \emph{remove} absolute paths of files to remove. This will be missing if there
is nothing to remove
\item \emph{old} old database (for debugging). This will be missing if there is no
old database or if a single file was rebuilt.
}
}
\description{
This takes in a vector of files and compares them against a text database of
files with checksums. It's been heavily adapted from blogdown to provide
utilities for removal and updating of the old database.
}
\details{
If you supply a single file into this function, we assume that you want that
one file to be rebuilt, so we will \emph{always} return that file in the \verb{$build}
element and update the md5 sum in the database (if it has changed at all).

If you supply multiple files, you are indicating that these are the \emph{only}
files you care about and the database will be updated accordingly, removing
entries missing from the sources.
