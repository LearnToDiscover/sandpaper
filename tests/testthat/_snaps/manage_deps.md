      -- Caching Build Packages for Generated Content --------------------------------
      The Carpentries lesson infrastructure uses the renv (R environment) package to
      maintain reproducibility for lessons with generated content. It looks like you
      have not yet used renv before, so this is a one-time message that gives you
      information about how the package cache can help you with your lesson.
      
      Finally, renv maintains a local cache of data on the filesystem, located at:
      
      - "/path/to/cache"
      
      This path can be customized: please see the documentation in `?renv::paths`.
      
      > This may take some time to set up the first time you use it, but once the
      cache is established, the process will run much more quickly.
      
      If you choose not to use the package cache, be aware that you may find
      differences between the lesson you render on your computer and what is rendered
      online.
